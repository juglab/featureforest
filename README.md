A napari plugin for segmentation using vision transformers' features.  
We developed a *napari* plugin to train a *Random Forest* model using extracted embeddings of ViT models for input and just a few scribble labels provided by the user. This approach can do the segmentation of desired objects almost as well as manual segmentations but in a much shorter time with less manual effort.

----------------------------------

## Documentation
The plugin documentation is [here](docs/index.md).

## Installation
It is highly recommended to use a python environment manager like [conda] to create a clean environment for installation.  
You can install all the requirements using provided environment config files:  
```bash
# for GPU
conda env create -f ./env_gpu.yml
```
```bash
# if you don't have a GPU
conda env create -f ./env_cpu.yml
```

### Requirements
- `python >= 3.9`
- `numpy`
- `opencv-python`
- `scikit-learn`
- `scikit-image`
- `matplotlib`
- `pyqt`
- `magicgui`
- `qtpy`
- `napari`
- `h5py`
- `pytorch=2.1.2`
- `torchvision=0.16.2`
- `timm`
- `pynrrd`

If you want to install the plugin manually using GPU, please follow the pytorch installation instruction [here](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/).  
For detailed napari installation see [here](https://napari.org/stable/tutorials/fundamentals/installation).  

### Installing The Plugin
If you use the conda `env.yml` file, the plugin will be installed automatically. But in case you already have the environment setup, 
you can just install the plugin. First clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/juglab/featureforest
```
Then run the following commands:
```bash
cd ./featureforest
pip install .
```

<!-- You can install `featureforest` via [pip]:

    pip install featureforest -->
